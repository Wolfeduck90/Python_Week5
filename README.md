Exploring polymorphism and Class attributes

## Description
This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and constructors. The files include:
1. A **Vehicle Polymorphism Program** showcasing polymorphism with various types of vehicles.
2. A **Superhero Class Program** with a hierarchical class structure and customizable features.

## Files
### 1. `polymorphism.py`
- **Purpose**: Explores polymorphism in action using different vehicle types (e.g., Car, Plane, Bicycle, Motorbike) that define the `move()` method uniquely.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports attributes like `speed` and `fuel_type` to enhance realism.
  - Demonstrates industry-standard comments and personalizable sections.

### 2. `class.py`
- **Purpose**: Creates a Superhero class with unique attributes (`name`, `power`, and `catchphrase`) and methods to simulate heroic actions. Includes an Antihero subclass for inheritance demonstration.
- **Key Features**:
  - Employs constructors for object initialization.
  - Facilitates exploration of encapsulation and inheritance.
